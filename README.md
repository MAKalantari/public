i upload my public codes and projects here.

word finder/replacer
------------------------------------------------
written with: codeblocks 17.12-gcc and c++11<br/>
it's a simple project to find a specific word in a string, highlight it and then replacing it with some new word.<br/>
.hpp file is a header file for those who want to use it in their projects.<br/>
.cpp files are included with main() function.<br/>
to see what this code exactly does, i recommend you to download the "word_finder_replacer_withVisualContent.cpp".<br/>

Command Line Maker (windows only)
------------------------------------------------
written with: who gives a fuck, c++?<br/>
.h file is the main(and only) header file.<br/>
example.cpp file is a simple and useful guide for using the header properly.
